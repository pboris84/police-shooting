# Police shootings

My server: http://students.washington.edu/borisp/info343/police-shooting/

Note to Grader: I got my http://localhost:8000/ server to show the .json file map 
markers just fine, but on my student server its not showing up, the code is all there, 
so if you clone it to your machine, and run a local host to process the json file. It 
will run fine on your machine too.
